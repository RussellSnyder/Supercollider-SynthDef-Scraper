# SuperCollider File Parser
## Scraping SynthDefs and more to place into consumable JSON form

### About

### Why?

There are lots of code examples online, but it's hard to know how they are related to one another.
With a focus on Synthdefs, by scraping metadata and variations from many .scd files, similarities will start to arise without having to listen and tweek each synth def 


### End game

a web-based app to help you bootstrap a supercollider project using known sytnhs and best practices

## TODO

[ ] Decide on best format for data scraping
[ ] Enrich and Scrape all of the SynthDefPool SynthDefs
[ ] Pull in more Synth pools and repeat
